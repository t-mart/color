# Color Schemes That I Seem To Keep Coming Back To

Hosted at <https://color.tim-martin.com>.

A few color schemes that I seem to keep coming back to. I've created this project to help me remember them and to make it easier to use them in my projects.

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install`:

```bash
npm run dev -- --open
```

### Add more color schemes

[Add to the JSON file here](./src/color.json).
